## About This Project

This project explores a reversed dynamic in the interaction between Large Language Models (LLMs) and software engineers. Traditionally, engineers might use LLMs as tools or assistants. Here, we flip the script.

### The Junior Developer Dilemma

Current AI agents, while powerful, often operate at the level of a junior developer. They can generate code, answer questions, and perform tasks, but they lack the deep context, architectural understanding, and nuanced decision-making capabilities of experienced engineers. Relying heavily on them without critical oversight can lead to suboptimal solutions, technical debt, or subtle errors. Trusting them implicitly with complex engineering tasks is premature.

### Reversing the Relationship

This application experiments with reversing this relationship. Instead of the engineer prompting a junior-level AI, the AI (acting as an architect or senior lead) directs the human engineer (acting as an editor or implementer). We use a familiar UI platform – the integrated development environment (IDE) and version control system (git) – as the medium for this interaction. The AI provides instructions, and the human executes them, leveraging their expertise for implementation details, quality control, and critical feedback.

### Goals and Vision

The goal is to investigate how this reversed interaction model can leverage the strengths of both AI (broad knowledge, pattern recognition, instruction generation) and human engineers (deep expertise, critical thinking, implementation skills). Can this lead to more efficient workflows, better knowledge transfer, or novel ways of building software? This project serves as a testbed for these ideas.
